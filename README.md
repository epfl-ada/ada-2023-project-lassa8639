## Abstract 📝
<!-- A brief overview (around 150 words) describing the project's idea and goals. Discuss the motivation behind the project, the story you aim to tell, and why it's significant. -->

## Research Questions ❓
<!-- - List the specific research questions you plan to address during the project. This helps to outline the scope and focus of your data analysis. -->

## Proposed Additional Datasets 📊
<!-- - If applicable, provide a list of additional datasets you intend to use. Include details on how you plan to acquire, manage, process, and enrich these datasets. Consider data size and format, and demonstrate that you've familiarized yourself with relevant documentation. -->
- Our analysis is well-supported by the existing (huge) dataset, and we find it sufficiently comprehensive for our research questions. Thus, we won't be incorporating additional datasets.

## Methods 🔍
<!-- - Briefly describe the methods and techniques you intend to use for the data analysis. This could include statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or any other relevant approaches. -->
Methods and techniques divided by each dataset that we intend to use for our analysis : 
- ### Video metadata [yt_metadata_en.jsonl.gz] :
- ### Channel metadata [df_channels_en.tsv.gz] : 
- ### Time-series data [df_timeseries_en.csv.gz] : 
- ### Comment table [youtube_comments.tsv.gz] : 
    Given considerations of project feasibility, including both the size and type of data required, the utilization of this dataset is omitted.


## Proposed Timeline & Internal Milestones (IM) 📅

| Task                         | Start Week | End Week  |
| -------------------          | ---------- | --------- |
| Idea Generation              | Week       | Week      |
| Data Story Context           | Week       | Week      |
| Data Preprocessing           | Week       | Week      |
| First Analysis & Results     | Week       | Week      |
| Comparative Evaluation       | Week       | Week      |
| Second Analysis & Results    | Week       | Week      |
| Web Site Implementation      | Week       | Week      |
| Final Check & Submission     | Week       | Week      |

- Note that between the Week 9 to 11 we'll also have the Homework 2 to work on it. The time will be split between the project and the homework.


## Organization Within the Team 🤝
<!-- - List internal milestones for the team, leading up to project Milestone P3. This section helps ensure everyone is on the same page regarding responsibilities and progress. -->
In the pursuit of enhanced efficiency, task allocation within our team adheres to a systematic approach. Given the existence of three entirely independent datasets, distinct teams have been designated for each dataset : the [Video Metadata](#video-metadata), [Channel Metadata](#channel-metadata), and [Time-series Data](#time-series-data). 

Recognizing the challenging nature of the [Video Metadata](#video-metadata) dataset, a proportionally augmented team has been assigned to navigate its complexities. Concurrently, parallel efforts are dedicated to exploring the data story, web site implementation, and the comprehensive contextual framework of the analysis. 

After we look at the data and get some initial results, we'll compare them. In the next rounds of analysis, we might work together to combine datasets if it makes sense. This way, everyone on the team stays involved and contributes to the analysis.




## Questions for TAs ❓
<!-- - Include any questions you have for the teaching assistants regarding the proposed project. This is an optional section, but it's a good opportunity to seek clarification or guidance. -->
