## Abstract üìù
<!-- A brief overview (around 150 words) describing the project's idea and goals. Discuss the motivation behind the project, the story you aim to tell, and why it's significant. -->

In this study, we try to investigate the trend of the mental health on Youtube and how it can influence new content generated as well as new channels creation.
We use the dataset YouNiverse and we filter it, identifying the mental health related videos as the ones containing, in title, description or tag, some key words like INSERT.
By then looking at the channels categories of these videos, at the visualization evolution of the channels and the videos and with other methods, we aim to detect the influence that talking about mental health can have. An eventual correlation will then allow us to breakdown the different reasons for this to happen, and will lead us to make several different conclusions about mental health discussion on Youtube.


## Research Questions ‚ùì
<!-- - List the specific research questions you plan to address during the project. This helps to outline the scope and focus of your data analysis. -->
Here are the specific research questions we plan to address :
- Is mental health a trends on Youtube ?
- Which topics predominate in the mental health category ? 
- Is there an impact on new content ? 
- Did old channels (who were not speaking about mental health) start speaking about (i.e followed the trends) ?
- Can we see an increase (or decrease) in performance (subscribers, views, likes, ...) for channels that speak about mental health ?


## Proposed Additional Datasets üìä
<!-- - If applicable, provide a list of additional datasets you intend to use. Include details on how you plan to acquire, manage, process, and enrich these datasets. Consider data size and format, and demonstrate that you've familiarized yourself with relevant documentation. -->
- Our analysis is well-supported by the existing (huge) dataset, and we find it sufficiently comprehensive for our research questions. Thus, we will not incorporate additional datasets.

## Methods üîç
<!-- - Briefly describe the methods and techniques you intend to use for the data analysis. This could include statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, or any other relevant approaches. -->
Methods and techniques divided by each dataset that we intend to use for our analysis: 
- ### [Video Metadata](#video-metadata-yt_metadata_enjsonlgz) [yt_metadata_en.jsonl.gz] :
There are several types of patterns of video numbers related to a certain topic:

1. Sudden Peaks: A sharp increase in the number of videos over a short period might suggest a trend, especially if it's followed by a sharp decline. Trends often correlate with a viral event or a fad that quickly gains and then loses public interest.

2. Gradual Increase: A steady or sequential increase in the number of videos over a longer period may indicate a growing concern or interest in an issue, suggesting it's an ongoing topic rather than a fleeting trend.

3. Sustained Levels: If after a rise, the number of videos remains consistently high instead of dropping back down, this could imply that the topic has evolved into an enduring issue.

4. Periodic Spikes: Repeated spikes could indicate recurring interest in a topic, which could be a trend that comes back in waves, possibly tied to seasonal events or recurring triggers. Examples are Black Friday as shown in our code, election, Olympics etc.

5. Plateaus: After a rise, if the graph levels off to a plateau, it might be indicative of a sustained discussion, which could mean the topic is an ongoing issue.

- ### [Channel Metadata](#channel-metadata-df_channels_entsvgz) [df_channels_en.tsv.gz] : 
- ### [Time-series Data](#time-series-data-df_timeseries_encsvgz) [df_timeseries_en.csv.gz] : 
- ### [Comment Table](#comment-table-youtube_commentstsvgz) [youtube_comments.tsv.gz] : 
    Given considerations of project feasibility, including both the size and type of data required, the utilization of this dataset is omitted.

| Task                              | Start Week | End Week  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Idea Generation                   | Week 1     | Week 6    |
| Data Story Context                | Week 7     | Week 7    |
| Data Preprocessing                | Week 7     | Week 8    |
| First Analysis & Results (IM1)    | Week 8     | Week 9    |
| Comparative Evaluation            | Week 9     | Week 10   |
| Second Analysis & Results (IM2)   | Week 10    | Week 13   |
| Web Site Implementation           | Week 10    | Week 13   |
| Final Check & Submission (IM3)    | Week 13    | Week 14   |

- Note that between the Week 9 to 11 we'll also have the Homework 2 to work on it. The time will be split between the project and the homework.

## Organization Within the Team ü§ù
<!-- - List internal milestones for the team, leading up to project Milestone P3. This section helps ensure everyone is on the same page regarding responsibilities and progress. -->
In the pursuit of enhanced efficiency, task allocation within our team adheres to a systematic approach. Given the existence of three entirely independent datasets, distinct teams have been designated for each dataset: the [Video Metadata](#video-metadata), [Channel Metadata](#channel-metadata), and [Time-series Data](#time-series-data).

Recognizing the challenging nature of the [Video Metadata](#video-metadata), a proportionally augmented team has been assigned to navigate its complexities. Concurrently, parallel efforts are dedicated to exploring the data story, web site implementation, and the comprehensive contextual framework of the analysis.

After we look at the data and get some initial results, we'll compare them. In the next rounds of analysis, we might work together to combine datasets if it makes sense. This way, everyone on the team stays involved and contributes to the analysis.

## Questions for TAs ‚ùì
